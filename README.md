# 🧠 Customer Intention Predictor (0% - 100%)

This project predicts **customer purchase intention** as a percentage between 0% and 100% using a regression model trained on customer interaction data. It also includes SQL-based behavioral feature extraction and a Gradio-based web interface for live model interaction.

---

## 📁 Project Structure
- A Jupyter Notebook with the complete ML workflow (project_ml.ipynb)

- SQL query used for feature engineering (MySQL_project.sql)

- Cleaned datasets (coustumer_data_for_ml_2.csv, data2.csv)

- Trained model (model.pkl)

- Python dependencies (requirements.txt)

- A ready-to-use UI using Gradio for real-time prediction

## 🚀 Objective

- Predict how likely a customer is to make a purchase based on behavioral data.
- Build a regression model that outputs the **purchase intention** as a percentage.
- Analyze raw event logs using SQL and use the output as features for ML.
- Provide a clean and interactive UI for real-time prediction using **Gradio**.
